# Algorithmic Complexity

Workshop and exercises to develop an understanding of algorithmic complexity and data structures, as well as get to grips with writing simple functions in **Python**.

#### Complexity
The amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute an algorithm. Our aim is to reduce complexity in our algorithms, i.e. make them more efficient. Efficiency is one of the dimensions of a good piece of code.

#### My task
I created a framework to time different algorithms and compare their efficiency. It plots results using matplotlib. First I tested out python in-built functions e.g. sort. Then I wrote my own, trying to be as efficient as possible. I ran the code on varying sizes of arrays.
